## Introduction

The EKS Controller enables you to manage AWS services using Kubernetes-native resources. This integration allows developers to use Kubernetes APIs to interact with AWS services, enhancing automation and efficiency. 

For the latest releases, visit [this link](https://github.com/mohandasaiah/eks-controller/releases). You can download the necessary files and execute them as needed.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Easily manage AWS resources from within your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Declarative Configuration**: Use Kubernetes manifests to define and manage your AWS resources.
- **Extensible**: Add new AWS services and features as needed.
- **Community Driven**: Contributions from the community enhance functionality and stability.

## Installation

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the EKS Controller to manage AWS resources. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to create an S3 bucket:

1. **Create a Manifest**:
   Create a file named `s3-bucket.yaml` with the following content:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: s3.services.k8s.aws/v1alpha1
   kind: Bucket
   metadata:
     name: my-s3-bucket
   spec:
     location: us-west-2
   ```

2. **Apply the Manifest**:
   Run the following command to create the S3 bucket:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f s3-bucket.yaml
   ```

3. **Check the Status**:
   Verify the bucket creation:
   ```bash
   kubectl get buckets
   ```

## Configuration

You can configure the EKS Controller to suit your needs. The configuration can be done through Kubernetes manifests. Here are some common configurations:

- **IAM Roles**: Ensure that your Kubernetes service account has the necessary IAM roles attached to access AWS resources.
- **Region Configuration**: Specify the AWS region in your manifests to ensure resources are created in the correct location.
