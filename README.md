# ACK service controller for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

This repository contains source code for the AWS Controllers for Kubernetes
(ACK) service controller for Amazon EKS.

Please [log issues][ack-issues] and feedback on the main AWS Controllers for
Kubernetes Github project.

[ack-issues]: https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/community/issues

## Getting started

To install the `eks-controller` on your cluster, follow the the
[installation][ack-install] instructions.

Currently, the `eks-controller` is GA and supports the following resources:
- `Cluster`
- `Nodegroup`
- `FargateProfile`
- `Addon`
- `PodIdentityAssociation`
- `AccessEntry`

A detailed list of the resources supported specifications can be found in the
[references][ack-references] section.

## Annotations

For some resources, the `eks-controller` supports annotations to customize the
behavior of the controller. The following annotations are supported:

- **Nodegroup**
    - `eks.services.k8s.aws/desired-size-managed-by`: used to control whether the
      controller should manage the desiredSize of the Nodegroup `spec.ScalingConfig.DesiredSize`.
      It supports the following values:
        - `ack-eks-controller`: If set, the controller will be responsible for
          managing the desired size of the nodegroup.
        - `external-autoscaler`: If set, will ignore any changes to the
          `spec.ScalingConfig.DesiredSize` and will not manage the desired size
          of the nodegroup.

      If not set, the controller will default to `ack-eks-controller`.

    - `eks.services.k8s.aws/force-update-version`: used to force the version
      update of the nodegroup. If set to `true`, and the controller detects a
      a change in the nodegroup, it will set the `force` attribute to `true`
      in the `UpdateNodeGroupConfig` API call.
